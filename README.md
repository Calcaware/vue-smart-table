> Vue Smart Table lets you deploy beautiful tables when you are in a hurry and all you got is a tangled json from the backend.

> After such a hack you are left with super mainainable code because the table is completely modular and divided in components.

> You can then pick it up and perfect your work without long rewrites.

## Usage

Basically you write this

```html
<smart-table
    :auto-load="true"
    body-path="results"
    id-col="id.value"
    endpoint="http://api.randomuser.me/?results=20"
    :header="[
    {key: 'name.first', label: 'name'},
    {key: 'name.last', label: 'surname'},
    {key: 'gender'},
    {key: 'phone+cell', label: 'contacts'},
    {key: 'picture.thumbnail', label: 'avatar'}
    {key: 'nat', label: 'nationality'}
    ]"
    :order-by="['name.first', 'name.last']"
    >
   <src2img col="picture.thumbnail"></src2img><!-- renders pictures -->
   <contacts col="phone+cell"></contacts><!-- custom formatting -->
   <nationality col="nat"></nationality><!-- queries a remote server for country code to country name conversion -->
   <fontawesome col="gender"></fontawesome><!-- font awesome! -->
  </smart-table>
```

and you get this

## Installation

#### Webpack/Browserify

``` bash
npm install vue-smart-table --save
```

In your app then you write:

``` javascript
import SmartTable from "vue-smart-table"
Vue.component('smart-table', SmartTable)
```

#### &lt;script&gt; tag inside your page

``` html
<!-- optional in your head -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://npmcdn.com/vue-smart-table@2.5.0/dist/static/vue-smart-table-default.css">
<!-- at the end of your body -->
<script src="https://npmcdn.com/vue-smart-table@2.5.0/dist/static/vue-smart-table.js"></script>
```

Thatâ€™s it! The component will register itself!

 ---

After that you can freely use it in your templates:

``` html
<smart-table :body="[{hello:'world'}]"></smart-table>
```

The format of the `body` prop is like the following:

  { _id: 92, name: 'Fulano', surname: 'Perro' } ]
```
